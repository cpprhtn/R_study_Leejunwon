Aeschylus	Time as he grows old teaches many lessons
Alexander Graham Bell	Mr. Watson, come here. I want you!
Benjamin Franklin	It is hard for an empty bag to stand upright
Benjamin Franklin	Little strokes fell great oaks
Benjamin Franklin	Remember that time is money
Miguel de Cervantes	Bell, book, and candle
Proverbs 15:1	A soft answer turneth away wrath
Theodore Roosevelt	Speak softly and carry a big stick
William Shakespeare	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
Robert Burton	I light my candle from their torches.
